# 🧬 Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the automated detection of cancer from histopathological images. The model aims to assist medical professionals in early cancer diagnosis by providing fast and reliable image-based classification.

## 🚀 Overview

- 🔍 **Problem**: Manual detection of cancer from pathology slides is time-consuming and prone to error.
- 🎯 **Goal**: Develop a deep learning model to accurately classify cancerous vs. non-cancerous images.
- 🧠 **Approach**: Use transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs, data augmentation, and image preprocessing to build a robust classification pipeline.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled histopathological images categorized into cancerous and non-cancerous classes.

> Note: Due to size and licensing, the dataset is not included in the repository. You can use datasets from sources like:
- [Kaggle – Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection)
- [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/tcga)

## 🧪 Model Performance

- **Model Used**: Custom CNN / VGG16 / ResNet50 (via transfer learning)
- **Accuracy**: ~94%
- **Precision / Recall**: High precision on cancer class, suitable for screening use-cases
- **Visualization**: Training curves, confusion matrix, and sample predictions included in the notebook

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Binary classification (Cancer vs. No Cancer)
- ✅ Data augmentation to reduce overfitting
- ✅ Transfer learning with pre-trained networks
- ✅ Model performance visualization
- ✅ Extensible for multi-class or multi-type detection

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Deploy model via web app (Streamlit / Flask)
- Add XAI features like Grad-CAM for interpretability
- Incorporate real-time microscope camera integration
- Extend to detect specific cancer types or grades
